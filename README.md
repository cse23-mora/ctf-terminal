# Terminal Web Repository

This repository contains two main components:

1. **`secure_terminal/`** – Rust-based library and WebAssembly package for secure terminal operations. It includes source code in `src/`, build artifacts in `target/`, and frontend bindings in `pkg/`.
2. **`web/`** – A simple web interface (`index.html`) that interacts with the secure terminal functionality.

Each component has its own README for more details.  The root of the workspace holds this overview file.
